The gambling problem can be set out as follows.
The probability of running out of money P(n) can be defined as:

                P(n) = 0.5P(n-1) + 0.5P(n+2)   
                with P(0) = 1
                
or equivalently P(n+2) = 2P(n) - P(n-1)

This is effectively a polynomial with a characteristic equation of 
                x^3 = 2x - 1

Solving the equation, we get roots of 1, 0.5(sqrt(5) - 1), 0.5(-1 - sqrt(5)) thus

                P(n) = a*1^n + b*(alpha-1)^n + c*(-alpha)^n
                where: alpha = 0.5 + sqrt(5)/2 
                a + b + c = 1 as P(0) = 1
       
We know that as the amount of money (n) the gambler starts with increases, the probability of running out of money P(n)
decreases thus as n -> infinity, P(n) -> 0. This means a has to be equal to 0 if not as n -> inf, P(n) cannot tend to 0
Also, as n increases and becomes very large. if c>0 and n is an even number, P(n) > 1. if n is odd, P(n) < 0 and vice 
versa for c<0 therefore c has to be equal to zero.

We can thus simplify the probability of running out of money P(n) as:
                P(n) = (alpha-1)^n where b = 1

Starting with Â£10, the probability of running out of money is approximately 0.813%
